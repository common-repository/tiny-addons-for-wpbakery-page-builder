== Description ==

<h3>Values</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simple, bloat free and without obnoxious branding.</li>
<li>Minimal styles, customize it with your own CSS. Perfect for web designers.</li>
<li>Free, without premium version and nagware.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Current Addons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Card: This widget is intended as a two-toned card element. At the top you can upload your own background image, set an icon and a title. At the bottom you can use text, HTML, and also add a button.</li>
<li>Image Box: This widget is an image box element mostly used as a fancy way to link to other pages. You can set your background image, title, subtitle and link. It features a nice "zoom" animation when you hover.</li>
<li>Logo List: This widget outputs an inline list of images. It's really useful as a featured clients list.</li>
<li>Widget for Facebook: This is the official widget of a Facebook Page. You must submit your Page Name, Page URL and Facebook App ID. It isn't any different as embedding your own code but if you are building a website for someone else it is much cleaner to do it this way.</li>
</ul>
